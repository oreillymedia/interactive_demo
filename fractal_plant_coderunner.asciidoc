== Create fractal plants with processing

"Fractal" is the broad name for a whole class of recursively defined mathematical objects that range from psychedelic ((Mandelbrot Sets)) to ornate Koch Snowflakes. Despite their geometric complexity and intimidating-sounding math, fractals are surprisingly simple, and are almost always based on a few easy rules. This article shows you a quick Processing script that generates a fractal-like plant that looks something like this:

Each "plant" begins as a straight line. This line is replaced with a new "branch" that consists of the original line plus 3-4 new alternating branches. (The exact number of branches is determined by a variable you can set). This same process is applied recursively for each new branch, up to a depth you specify. The following figure illustrates the basic idea:

Lines are represented as vectors. A ((vector)) consists of an origin point defined by the variables x and y, a length defined by the variable r, and an angle defined by the variable theta. The following figure shows how these variables are related:
